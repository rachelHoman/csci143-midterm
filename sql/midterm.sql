/* PROBLEM 1:
 *
 * The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is the portion of the US government that enforces international sanctions.
 * OFAC is conducting an investigation of the Pagila company to see if you are complying with sanctions against North Korea.
 * Current sanctions limit the amount of money that can be transferred into or out of North Korea to $5000 per year.
 * (You don't have to read the official sanctions documents, but they're available online at <https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information/north-korea-sanctions>.)
 * You have been assigned to assist the OFAC auditors.
 *
 * Write a SQL query that:
 * Computes the total revenue from customers in North Korea.
 *
 * NOTE:
 * All payments in the pagila database occurred in 2022,
 * so there is no need to do a breakdown of revenue per year.

/* PROBLEM 2:

 * Lists the first and last names of all actors who have appeared in movies in the "Family" category,
 * but that have never appeared in movies in the "Horror" category.
 * For each actor, you should also list the total amount that customers have paid to rent films that the actor has been in.
 * Order the results so that actors generating the most revenue are at the top.
